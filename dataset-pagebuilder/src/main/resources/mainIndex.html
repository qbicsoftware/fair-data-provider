    <h3>What is Fairy?</h3>
    <p>The tool Fairy is part of a proof of concept implementation for a bachelor thesis. <br>
    The concept that should be proven here is inspired by the idea of a semantic web and therefore basically  <br>uses the structure of the world wide web to make our datasets findable by search engines.</p>
    <p>To make this happen, the landing page of each dataset is marked up with json-ld. <br>This markup provides the metadata of the dataset as structured data. To make a search engine "understand" the context of the data, we used <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</p>
    <p>Now, if the webcrawler of search engines like Google or its dataset search crawl the landing pages, they can index the provided metadata and portray them as rich results. <br>Like this, the datasets and information about them can easily be found by a simple Google search. </p>
    <p>Just as a small disclaimer, this tool is still in the process of development and the datasets that are currently available here are only testing datasets.</p>
    <h3>How can I use it?</h3>
    <p>Fairy is supposed to be a lightweight and easy to use tool. It is available on GitHub. You can also get there via the "Tool" button above.</p>
